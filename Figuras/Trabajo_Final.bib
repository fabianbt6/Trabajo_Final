abstract = {Empirical studies that rely on a linear framework typically fail to find evidence of a causal link between financial integration and economic growth. In this study, we extend the analysis by applying both linear and nonlinear Granger-causality tests to data for 19 emerging and developing countries. Consistent with previous research, the linear causality analysis reveals only weak causal linkages between financial integration and economic growth. In contrast, the nonlinear causality analysis provides evidence of significant nonlinear causality in 18 out of 19 countries. The growth hypothesis holds true for Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Morocco, Tunisia, and Venezuela whereas a reverse relation was found in Brazil, Chile, Cote d'Ivoire, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Egypt, South Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, and Paraguay. The feedback hypothesis also exists in Bolivia and Uruguay. Overall, the divergent results in the 19 countries imply that policies cannot be uniformly implemented as there would have been different effects in each country.},

@article{Aghion2004,
abstract = {This paper introduces a framework for analyzing the role of financial factors as a source of instability in small open economies. Our basic model is a dynamic open economy model with a tradeable good produced with capital and a country-specific factor. We also assume that firms face credit constraints, with the constraint being tighter at a lower level of financial development. A basic implication of this model is that economies at an intermediate level of financial development are more unstable than either very developed or very underdeveloped economies. This is true both in the sense that temporary shocks have large and persistent effects and also in the sense that these economies can exhibit cycles. Thus, countries that are going through a phase of financial development may become more unstable in the short run. Similarly, full capital account liberalization may destabilize the economy in economies at an intermediate level of financial development: phases of growth with capital inflows are followed by collapse with capital outflows. On the other hand, foreign direct investment does not destabilize. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This study considers the effects of financial development on output in a panel cointegration framework, focusing on the implications of trade and financial openness. Our analysis indicates that after controlling for cross-sectional dependence, the typical relationship between finance and output does not hold in the long run. This relationship, however, is re-established once we account for economic openness. While trade openness emerges as more important for developing countries, financial openness is more important for advanced economies. In the long run, causality runs from financial development to output in the advanced economies, while in developing economies causality is bidirectional. There is no short-run causality between financial development and output, however.},

Using a fully balanced panel of 24 economies from 1983 to 2013, the study shows that when imposing a linear relationship, the financial development and economic growth are negatively associated in the long run. The panel granger causality tests establish the bidirectional causality between the financial development variables with growth. Employing an alternate approach of moderated mediation effect framework, we notice that the association of financial development with economic growth is moderated by the negative impacts of inflation, interest rate, and population dependency; and the positive mediation effect of trade openness. The policy implication is that there is a need to rein in inflation and real interest rates and enhance trade openness to optimize the benefits of growing financial development on economic growth.},

Hence we are able to disseminate between the causality in the median and the tails of the conditional distribution. Our findings indicate that there is a significant, negative causal relationship running from financial stress to economic activity in both countries. However, the changes in the financial stress level in Germany start influencing the industrial production earlier (when economic activity is at lower levels) than in the UK. Our results highlight the emphasis on the consideration of the entire conditional distribution to avoid the risk of misleading inferences on the causality analysis.},

But many of the actions of these hormones occur too rapidly to be explained in this manner, particularly their effects on the central nervous system. This text deals with recent discoveries showing that steroids can modulate the activity of some neurotransmitters. It explores the role of GABA as an important regulator of neuronal activity in the central nervous system and its inhibitory action as mediated via the GABA receptor and potentiated by steroids. In addition, the binding of steroids to cell membranes, the components involved and the outcome of such interactions are described. Also discusses possible uses of steroids as anesthetics and anticonvulsants. {\textcopyright} 2010 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Inc.},

abstract = {This book provides a wide-ranging account of the literature on co-integration and the modelling of integrated processes (those which accumulate the effects of past shocks). Data series which display integrated behaviour are common in economics, although techniques appropriate to analysing such data are of recent origin and there are few existing expositions of the literature. This book focuses on the exploration of relationships among integrated data series and the exploitation of these relationships in dynamic econometric modelling. The concepts of co-integration and error-correction models are fundamental components of the modelling strategy. This area of time-series econometrics has grown in importance over the past decade and is of interest to econometric theorists and applied econometricians alike. By explaining the important concepts informally, but also presenting them formally, the book bridges the gap between purely descriptive and purely theoretical accounts of the literature. The asymptotic theory of integrated processes is described and the tools provided by this theory are used to develop the distributions of estimators and test statistics. Practical modelling advice, and the use of techniques for systems estimation, are also emphasized. A knowledge of econometrics, statistics, and matrix algebra at the level of a final-year undergraduate or first-year undergraduate course in econometrics is sufficient for most of the book. Other mathematical tools are described as they occur.},

Para esto se utiliza el indicador de Boone, una propuesta no estructural que surge de la nueva teor{\'{i}}a de la organizaci{\'{o}}n industrial. El estudio se aborda a partir de dos estimaciones. Primero, el indicador de Boone individual para cada entidad bancaria y segundo, un indicador mensual para el sistema agregado. Para realizar las estimaciones se utiliza la metodolog{\'{i}}a sugerida por Griffith, Boone y Harrison (2005). Se concluye que el mercado no es competitivo, que las entidades bancarias privadas son en promedio m{\'{a}}s competitivas que las estatales y que durante el periodo de crisis se presenci{\'{o}} una disminuci{\'{o}}n en el grado de competitividad del sistema bancario costarricense.},
